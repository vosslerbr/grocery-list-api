# Grocery List API

This is the API for my Grocery List app. Socket.io is used for much of the functionality to allow for real-time collaboration on lists.

## Current Features

### Lists

Right now users can create lists, which contain 1 or more categories. Categories contain one or more items.

For example, a list for Costco might have a category called 'Dairy', which contains items for 'Eggs', 'Milk', and 'Cheese'.

## Planned Features

### Shared Lists

Users will be able to share lists to one or more people via email. All users on a list will be able to edit the list in real time together on their own devices.

### Recipe Database

So users can save their own recipes or links to recipes online, then add the ingredients from those recipes directly to their lists.

### Pantry

So users can keep an inventory of ingredients they physically have at home. I'm hoping to integrate some sort of NFC scanning here, as well as expiration/low quantity alerts.
